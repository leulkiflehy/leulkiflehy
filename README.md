# Hey there

I'm **Leul Kifle**, a data science student based in Virginia.

I analyze real-world datasets, build machine learning models, and create clear visualizations to turn complex data into meaningful insights. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and R, and I love building projects that solve real problems.

## Projects

### Profanity in Hip-Hop Lyrics and Spotify Popularity
Conducted an end-to-end data analysis project exploring whether profanity in hip-hop lyrics influences Spotify popularity scores.

**Key Work Included:**
- Collected, filtered, and sampled a large Spotify lyrics dataset  
- Performed extensive text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, regex-based cleaning)  
- Implemented rule-based profanity detection using a curated profanity lexicon  
- Created visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud  
- Analyzed correlations between profanity levels and popularity metrics  

**Outcome:**  
The analysis found no meaningful relationship between profanity usage and Spotify popularity, suggesting that factors like artist influence, playlisting, and marketing have a stronger impact on engagement than lyrical content alone.
