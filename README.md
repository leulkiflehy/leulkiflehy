## 📂 Projects
Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on:

### 🔹 Air Quality & Education Data Analysis
Analyzed multiple public datasets (Air Quality Index, SAT Scores, and Education Levels) using Python to uncover correlations and build data visualizations.

### 🔹 Python + SQL Database Project
Built and analyzed a structured dataset using Python (Pandas, SQLite) to extract patterns and optimize data queries.

### 🔹 Airline Network Analysis
Used NetworkX to build a graph of airline routes, identify top connecting hubs, and visualize network structure using Matplotlib.

(You can find all project repositories in my GitHub profile.)
